# fcn-simple-segmentation

Implementation of FCN with focal loss based on: (Focal FCN: Towards Small Object Segmentation with Limited Training Data)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01506v1]

This model performs well on mobile devices due to lightweight and simplicity. For model format conversion see (ONNX)[https://github.com/onnx/onnx]

Few modifications can re-purpose this into an object detection model

image transformation code also available
